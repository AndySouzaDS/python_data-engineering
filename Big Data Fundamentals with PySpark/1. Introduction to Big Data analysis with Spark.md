## # What is Big Data?
`Big Data` study and application of datasets that are too complex for traditional data processing sotfware

`Big Data (3 Vs)`
- Volume: Size of the data
- Variety: Different sources and formats
- Velocity: Speed of the data
### # Big Data concepts and Terminology

- `Clustered computing:` Collection of resources of multiple machines
- `Parallel computing:` Simultaneous computation
- `Distributed computing:` Collection of nodes (networked computers) that run in parallel
- `Batch processing:` Breaking the job into small pieces and running them on individual
machines
- `Real-time processing:` Immediate processing of data
### # Big Data processing systems

- Hadoop/MapReduce: Scalable and fault tolerant framework written in Java
  - Open source
  - Batch processing
- Apache Spark: General purpose and lightning fast cluster computing system
  - Open source
  - Both batch and real-time data processing
### # Features of Apache Spark framework
- Distributed cluster computing framework
- Efficient in-memory computations for large data sets
- Lightning fast data processing framework
- Provides support for Java, Scala, Python, R and SQL
### # Spark modes of deployment
- `Local mode:` Single machine such as your laptop
  - Local model convenient for testing, debugging and demonstration
- `Cluster mode:` Set of pre-defined machines
  - Good for production
- Workflow: Local-> clusters
- No code change necessary
