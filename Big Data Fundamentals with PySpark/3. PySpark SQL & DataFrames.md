## RDD to DataFrame
Instructions
- [x] Create an RDD from the sample_list.
- [x] Create a PySpark DataFrame using the above RDD and schema.
- [x] Confirm the output as PySpark DataFrame.
```py
# Create a list of tuples
sample_list = [('Mona',20), ('Jennifer',34), ('John',20), ('Jim',26)]

# Create an RDD from the list
rdd = sc.parallelize(sample_list)

# Create a PySpark DataFrame
names_df = spark.createDataFrame(rdd, schema=['Name', 'Age'])

# Check the type of names_df
print("The type of names_df is", type(names_df))

# The type of names_df is <class 'pyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame'>
```
## Loading CSV into DataFrame
Instructions
- [x] Create a DataFrame from file_path variable which is the path to the people.csv file.
- [x] Confirm the output as PySpark DataFrame.
```py
# Create an DataFrame from file_path # people.csv
people_df = spark.read.csv(file_path, header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Check the type of people_df
print("The type of people_df is", type(people_df))

# The type of people_df is <class 'pyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame'>
```
##  Inspecting data in PySpark DataFrame
Instructions
- [x] Print the first 10 observations in the people_df DataFrame.
- [x] Count the number of rows in the people_df DataFrame.
- [x] How many columns does people_df DataFrame have and what are their names?
```py
# Print the first 10 observations 
people_df.show(10)

# Count the number of rows 
print("There are {} rows in the people_df DataFrame.".format(people_df.count()))

# Count the number of columns and their names
print("There are {} columns in the people_df DataFrame and their names are {}".format(len(people_df.columns), people_df.columns))

''' result :

There are 100000 rows in the people_df DataFrame.
There are 5 columns in the people_df DataFrame and their names are ['_c0', 'person_id', 'name', 'sex', 'date of birth']
'''
```
## PySpark DataFrame subsetting and cleaning
- [x] Select 'name', 'sex' and 'date of birth' columns from people_df and create people_df_sub DataFrame.
- [x] Print the first 10 observations in the people_df DataFrame.
- [x] Remove duplicate entries from people_df_sub DataFrame and create people_df_sub_nodup DataFrame.
- [x] How many rows are there before and after duplicates are removed?
```py
# Select name, sex and date of birth columns
people_df_sub = people_df.select('name', 'sex', 'date of birth')

# Print the first 10 observations from people_df_sub
people_df_sub.show(10)

# Remove duplicate entries from people_df_sub
people_df_sub_nodup = people_df_sub.dropDuplicates()

# Count the number of rows
print("There were {} rows before removing duplicates, and {} rows after removing duplicates".format(people_df_sub.count(), people_df_sub_nodup.count()))

# There were 100000 rows before removing duplicates, and 99998 rows after removing duplicates
```
## Filtering your DataFrame
- [x] Filter the people_df DataFrame to select all rows where sex is female into people_df_female DataFrame.
- [x] Filter the people_df DataFrame to select all rows where sex is male into people_df_male DataFrame.
- [x] Count the number of rows in people_df_female and people_df_male DataFrames.
```py
# Filter people_df to select females 
people_df_female = people_df.filter(people_df.sex == "female")

# Filter people_df to select males
people_df_male = people_df.filter(people_df.sex == "male")

# Count the number of rows 
print("There are {} rows in the people_df_female DataFrame and {} rows in the people_df_male DataFrame".format(people_df_female.count(), people_df_male.count()))

# There are 49014 rows in the people_df_female DataFrame and 49066 rows in the people_df_male DataFrame
```
## Running SQL Queries Programmatically
- [x] Create a temporary table people that's a pointer to the people_df DataFrame.
- [x] Construct a query to select the names of the people from the temporary table people.
- [x] Assign the result of Spark's query to a new DataFrame - people_df_names.
- [x] Print the top 10 names of the people from people_df_names DataFrame.
```py
# Create a temporary table "people"
people_df.createOrReplaceTempView("people")

# Construct a query to select the names of the people from the temporary table "people"
query = '''SELECT name FROM people'''

# Assign the result of Spark's query to people_df_names
people_df_names = spark.sql(query)

# Print the top 10 names of the people
people_df_names.show(10)

'''
+----------------+
|            name|
+----------------+
|  Penelope Lewis|
|   David Anthony|
|       Ida Shipp|
|    Joanna Moore|
|  Lisandra Ortiz|
|   David Simmons|
|   Edward Hudson|
|    Albert Jones|
|Leonard Cavender|
|  Everett Vadala|
+----------------+
'''
```
## SQL queries for filtering Table
- [x] Filter the people table to select all rows where sex is female into people_female_df DataFrame.
- [x] Filter the people table to select all rows where sex is male into people_male_df DataFrame.
- [x] Count the number of rows in both people_female and people_male DataFrames.
```py
# Filter the people table to select female sex 
people_female_df = spark.sql('SELECT * FROM people WHERE sex=="female"')

# Filter the people table DataFrame to select male sex
people_male_df = spark.sql('SELECT * FROM people WHERE sex=="male"')

# Count the number of rows in both DataFrames
print("There are {} rows in the people_female_df and {} rows in the people_male_df DataFrames".format(people_female_df.count(), people_male_df.count()))

# There are 49014 rows in the people_female_df and 49066 rows in the people_male_df DataFrames
```
## PySpark DataFrame visualization
- [x] Print the names of the columns in names_df DataFrame.
- [x] Convert names_df DataFrame to df_pandas Pandas DataFrame.
- [x] Use matplotlib's plot() method to create a horizontal bar plot with 'Name' on x-axis and 'Age' on y-axis.
```py
# Check the column names of names_df
print("The column names of names_df are", names_df.columns)

# Convert to Pandas DataFrame  
df_pandas = names_df.toPandas()

# Create a horizontal bar plot
df_pandas.plot(kind='barh', x='Name', y='Age', colormap='winter_r')
plt.show()
```

## Part 1: Create a DataFrame from CSV file

- [x] Create a PySpark DataFrame from file_path (which is the path to the Fifa2018_dataset.csv file).
- [x] Print the schema of the DataFrame.
- [x] Print the first 10 observations.
- [x] How many rows are in there in the DataFrame?
```py
# Load the Dataframe
fifa_df = spark.read.csv(file_path, header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Check the schema of columns
fifa_df.printSchema()

# Show the first 10 observations
fifa_df.show(10)

# Print the total number of rows
print("There are {} rows in the fifa_df DataFrame".format(fifa_df.count()))

''' showing schema :
 |-- _c0: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- Name: string (nullable = true)
 |-- Age: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- Photo: string (nullable = true)
 |-- Nationality: string (nullable = true)......
# showing 10 rows
# There are 17981 rows in the fifa_df DataFrame
'''
```
