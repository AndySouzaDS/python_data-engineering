|  How should we organize data?  |

      . Schemas : how data be logically organized
      . Normalization : may data have minimal or redundant dependency?
      . Views : what joins more often?
      . Access Control : who and which levels of accesses
      . DBMS : pick SQL or noSQL
      
      # Depends on the intended use of data
