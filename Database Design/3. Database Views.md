## Tables vs. views

Views have been described as "virtual tables". It's true that views are similar to tables in certain aspects, but there are key differences. In this exercise, you will organize these differences and similarities.

Instructions
> Organize these characteristics into the category that they describe best.

* Only Tables:
   - Part of the physical schema of a database.
* Views & Tables
   - Contains rows and columns
   - Can be queried
   - Has access control
* Only Views

## Viewing views

Because views are very useful, it's common to end up with many of them in your database. It's important to keep track of them so that database users know what is available to them.

> The goal of this exercise is to get familiar with viewing views within a database and interpreting their purpose. This is a skill needed when writing database           documentation or organizing views.

Instructions 1/3

## Creating and querying a view

Have you ever found yourself running the same query over and over again? Maybe, you used to keep a text copy of the query in your desktop notes app, but that was all before you knew about views!

> In these Pitchfork reviews, we're particularly interested in high-scoring reviews and if there's a common thread between the works that get high scores. In this       exercise, you'll make a view to help with this analysis so that we don't have to type out the same query often to get these high-scoring reviews.

Instructions 1/2
- [x] Create a view called high_scores that holds reviews with scores above a 9.
