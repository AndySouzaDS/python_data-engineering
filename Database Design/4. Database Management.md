## #Database roles and access control

### #examples:
```sql
-- Create a GROUP rol:
CREATE ROLE data_analyst;

-- Rol w/ attributes set USER ROL:
CREATE ROLE intern
With password = 'PasswordForIntern'  VALID UNTIL '2020-01-01';

-- ROL admin:
CREATE ROL admin CREATEDB;
-- ALTER ROL admin:
ALTER ROL admin CREATEROL;

-- granting and revoking from roles:
GRANT UPDATE ON ratings TO data_analyst;

REVOKE UPDATE ON ratings FROM data_analyst;
```
## Create a role

A database role is an entity that contains information that define the role's privileges and interact with the client authentication system. Roles allow you to give different people (and often groups of people) that interact with your data different levels of access.

> Imagine you founded a startup. You are about to hire a group of data scientists. You also hired someone named Marta who needs to be able to login to your database.   You're also about to hire a database administrator. In this exercise, you will create these roles.

Instructions 3/3
- [x] 1. Create a role called data_scientist.
- [x] 2. Create a role called marta that has one attribute: the ability to login (LOGIN).
- [x] 3. Create a role called admin with the ability to create databases (CREATEDB) and to create roles (CREATEROLE).
```sql
-- Create a data scientist role
CREATE ROLE data_scientist;

-- 2
-- Create a role for Marta w/ login attribute
CREATE ROLE marta LOGIN;

--3
-- Create an admin role
CREATE ROLE admin WITH CREATEDB CREATEROLE;
```
## GRANT privileges and ALTER attributes

Once roles are created, you grant them specific access control privileges on objects, like tables and views. Common privileges being SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, etc.

> Imagine you're a cofounder of that startup and you want all of your data scientists to be able to update and insert data in the long_reviews view. In this exercise,   you will enable those soon-to-be-hired data scientists by granting their role (data_scientist) those privileges. Also, you'll give Marta's role a password.

Instructions

- [x] Grant the data_scientist role update and insert privileges on the long_reviews view.
- [x] Alter Marta's role to give her the provided password.
```sql
-- Grant data_scientist update and insert privileges
GRANT UPDATE, INSERT ON long_reviews TO data_scientist;

-- Give Marta's role a password, (already exists)
ALTER ROLE marta WITH PASSWORD 's3cur3p@ssw0rd';
```
## Add a user role to a group role

There are two types of roles: user roles and group roles. By assigning a user role to a group role, a database administrator can add complicated levels of access to their databases with one simple command.

> For your startup, your search for data scientist hires is taking longer than expected. Fortunately, it turns out that Marta, your recent hire, has previous data        science experience and she's willing to chip in the interim. In this exercise, you'll add Marta's user role to the data scientist group role. You'll then remove      her after you complete your hiring process.

Instructions

- [x] Add Marta's user role to the data scientist group role.
- [x] Celebrate! You hired multiple data scientists.
- [x] Remove Marta's user role from the data scientist group role.
```sql
-- Add Marta to the data scientist group
GRANT data_scientist TO marta;

-- Celebrate! You hired data scientists.

-- Remove Marta from the data scientist group
REVOKE data_scientist FROM marta;
```
## #Table partitioning
`why partition ?` table become slower, indecis don't fit memory

## Reasons to partition

Answer the question
> In the video, you saw some very good reasons to use partitioning. However, can you find which one wouldn't be a good reason to use partitioning?
Possible Answers
- [x] Improve data integrity
- [ ] Save records from 2017 or earlier on a slower medium
- [ ] Easily extend partitioning to sharding, and thus making use of parallelization
## Partitioning and normalization

In the video, you saw the differences between the two types of partitioning: vertical and horizontal partitioning. As you'd expect, the names suggest how these       different strategies work.
It might be a bit challenging to distinguish normalization, which you saw in previous chapters, from partitioning.

Instructions
> Can you classify the characteristics in the correct bucket?
- Normalization
  - Changes the loglcal data model 
  - Reduce redundancy In table
- Vertical Partitioning
  - (Example) Move the third and fourth column
    to separate table
  - Move specific columns to slower medium 
- Horizontal Partitioning
  - (Example) Use the timestamp to move rows
    from G4 Ina speciic table 
  - Sharding Is an extenslon on this, using
    muidple machines
## Creating vertical partitions

In the video, you learned about vertical partitioning and saw an example.

For vertical partitioning, there is no specific syntax in PostgreSQL. You have to create a new table with particular columns and copy the data there. Afterward, you can drop the columns you want in the separate partition. If you need to access the full table, you can do so by using a JOIN clause.

In this exercise and the next one, you'll be working with the example database called pagila. It's a database that is often used to showcase PostgreSQL features. The database contains several tables. We'll be working with the film table. In this exercise, we'll use the following columns:

film_id: the unique identifier of the film
long_description: a lengthy description of the film

Instructions 1/2
- [x] Create a new table film_descriptions containing 2 fields: film_id, which is of type INT, and long_description, which is of type TEXT.
- [x] Occupy the new table with values from the film table.
```sql
-- Create a new table called film_descriptions
CREATE TABLE film_descriptions (
    film_id INT,
    long_description TEXT
);

-- Copy the descriptions from the film table
INSERT INTO film_descriptions
SELECT film_id, long_description FROM film;
```
Instructions 2/2
- [x] Drop the field long_description from the film table.
- [x] Join the two resulting tables to view the original table.
```sql
-- Drop the descriptions from the original table
ALTER TABLE film DROP COLUMN long_description;

-- Join to view the original table
SELECT * FROM film 
JOIN film_descriptions USING(film_id);
```
## Creating horizontal partitions

In the video, you also learned about horizontal partitioning.

The example of horizontal partitioning showed the syntax necessary to create horizontal partitions in PostgreSQL. If you need a reminder, you can have a look at the slides.

In this exercise, however, you'll be using a list partition instead of a range partition. For list partitions, you form partitions by checking whether the partition key is in a list of values or not.

To do this, we partition by LIST instead of RANGE. When creating the partitions, you should check if the values are IN a list of values.

We'll be using the following columns in this exercise:

film_id: the unique identifier of the film
title: the title of the film
release_year: the year it's released

Instructions 1/3
- [x] Create the table film_partitioned, partitioned on the field release_year.
```sql
-- Create a new table called film_partitioned
CREATE TABLE film_partitioned (
  film_id INT,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  release_year TEXT
)
PARTITION BY LIST (release_year);
```
Instructions 2/3
- [x] Create three partitions: one for each release year: 2017, 2018, and 2019. Call the partition for 2019 film_2019, etc.
```sql
-- Create a new table called film_partitioned
CREATE TABLE film_partitioned (
  film_id INT,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  release_year TEXT
)
PARTITION BY LIST (release_year);

-- Create the partitions for 2019, 2018, and 2017
CREATE TABLE film_2019
	PARTITION OF film_partitioned FOR VALUES IN ('2019');

CREATE TABLE film_2018
	PARTITION OF film_partitioned FOR VALUES IN ('2018');

CREATE TABLE film_2017
	PARTITION OF film_partitioned FOR VALUES IN ('2017');
```
Instructions 3/3
- [x] Occupy the new table, film_partitioned, with the three fields required from the film table.
```sql
-- Create a new table called film_partitioned
CREATE TABLE film_partitioned (
  film_id INT,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  release_year TEXT
)
PARTITION BY LIST (release_year);

-- Create the partitions for 2019, 2018, and 2017
CREATE TABLE film_2019
	PARTITION OF film_partitioned FOR VALUES IN ('2019');

CREATE TABLE film_2018
	PARTITION OF film_partitioned FOR VALUES IN ('2018');

CREATE TABLE film_2017
	PARTITION OF film_partitioned FOR VALUES IN ('2017');

-- Insert the data into film_partitioned
INSERT INTO film_partitioned
SELECT film_id, title, release_year FROM film;

-- View film_partitioned
SELECT * FROM film_partitioned;
```
## #Data integration

## Data integration do's and dont's

You just learned a lot about data integration, let's check your understanding of the concepts.

Instructions
> Categorize the following items as being True or False when talking about data integration.
- False
  - You should choose whichever solutlon Is right for the Job right now.
  - Automated testing and proactive alerts are not needed.
  - Everybody should have access to sensltive data In the final vlew.
  - All your data has to be updated In real time In the final vlew.
  - Your data Integration solution, hand-coded or ETL tool, should work
    once and then you can use the resulting view to run querles forever.
  - After data Integration all your data should be lIn a single table.
- True
  - You should be careful choosing a hand-coded solutlon because of
    maintenance cost.
  - Data Integration should be business driven, e.g. what combination of
   data will be useful for the business.
  - Data In the final vlew can be updated In different Intervals.
  - My source data can be stored In different physlcal locatlons.
  - My source data can be In different formats and database management
    systems.
  - Belng able to access the deslred data through a single vlew does not
    mean all data Is stored together.
## Analyzing a data integration plan

You're a data analyst in a hospital that wants to make sure there is enough cough medicine should an epidemic break out. For this, you need to combine the historical health records with the upcoming appointments to see if you can detect a pattern similar to the last cold epidemic. Then, you need to make sure there is sufficient stock available or if the stock should be increased. To help tackle this problem, you created a data integration plan.

> Which risk is not clearly indicated on the data integration plan?

Possible Answers
- [ ] It is unclear if you took data governance into account.
- [ ] You didn't clearly show where your data originated from.
- [x] You should indicate that you plan to anonymize patient health records. 
- [ ] If data is lost during ETL you will not find out.
