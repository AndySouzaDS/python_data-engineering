### # accessing databases and collections
```py
''' Using [] '''
# client is a dictionary of databases
db = client ["nobel"]

# database is a dictionary of collections
prizes_collection = db[ "prizes "]
#####

''' Using . '''
#databases are attributes of a client
db = client.nobel

# collections are attributes of databases
prizes_collection = db[ "prizes " ]
```
### # count documents in a collection
```py
# Use empty document { }as a filter
filter = {}

# Count documents in a collection
n_prizes = db.prizes.count_documents(filter)
n_laureates = db.laureates.count_documents(filter)
```
    590
    934
```py
# Find one document to inspect
doc db.prizes. find_one (filter)
```
## Count documents in a collection

- [ ] The number of prizes and laureates are equal.
- [ ] Prizes outnumber laureates.
- [x] Laureates outnumber prizes.

## Listing databases and collections
Our MongoClient object is not actually a dictionary, so we can't call keys() to list the names of accessible databases. The same is true for listing collections of a database. Instead, we can list database names by calling .list_database_names() on a client instance, and we can list collection names by calling .list_collection_names() on a database instance.

Instructions
- [x] Save a list, called db_names, of the names of the databases managed by our connected client.
- [x] Similarly, save a list, called nobel_coll_names, of the names of the collections managed by the "nobel" database.
```py
# Save a list of names of the databases managed by client
# listing names that are not dict
db_names = client.list_database_names()
print(db_names)

# Save a list of names of the collections managed by the "nobel" database
nobel_coll_names = client.nobel.list_collection_names()
print(nobel_coll_names)

'''
['admin', 'config', 'local', 'nobel']
['laureates', 'prizes']
'''
```
