## # Intro to MongoDB and the Nobel Prize dataset
`MongoDB `is an open source NoSQL database. As a non-relational database, it can process structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. It uses a non-relational, document-oriented data model and a non-structured query language. MongoDB is highly flexible and enables you to combine and store multiple types of data

### # example

### # accessing databases and collections
```py
''' Using [] '''
# client is a dictionary of databases
db = client ["nobel"]

# database is a dictionary of collections
prizes_collection = db[ "prizes "]
#####

''' Using . '''
#databases are attributes of a client
db = client.nobel

# collections are attributes of databases
prizes_collection = db[ "prizes " ]
```
### # count documents in a collection
```py
# Use empty document { }as a filter
filter = {}

# Count documents in a collection
n_prizes = db.prizes.count_documents(filter)
n_laureates = db.laureates.count_documents(filter)
```
    590
    934
```py
# Find one document to inspect
doc db.prizes. find_one (filter)
```
## Count documents in a collection

- [ ] The number of prizes and laureates are equal.
- [ ] Prizes outnumber laureates.
- [x] Laureates outnumber prizes.

## Listing databases and collections
Our MongoClient object is not actually a dictionary, so we can't call keys() to list the names of accessible databases. The same is true for listing collections of a database. Instead, we can list database names by calling .list_database_names() on a client instance, and we can list collection names by calling .list_collection_names() on a database instance.

Instructions
- [x] Save a list, called db_names, of the names of the databases managed by our connected client.
- [x] Similarly, save a list, called nobel_coll_names, of the names of the collections managed by the "nobel" database.
```py
# Save a list of names of the databases managed by client
# listing names that are not dict
db_names = client.list_database_names()
print(db_names)

# Save a list of names of the collections managed by the "nobel" database
nobel_coll_names = client.nobel.list_collection_names()
print(nobel_coll_names)
```
    ['admin', 'config', 'local', 'nobel']
    ['laureates', 'prizes']
    
## List fields of a document
- `.find_one()` retrieve a single doc
    -  accepts an optional `filter` argument that specifies the pattern that the document must match.
    -  specify empty filter `filter = {}`       
```py
# Connect to the "nobel" database
db = client.nobel

# Retrieve sample prize and laureate documents
''' Fetch one document from each of the prizes and laureates collections '''
prize = db.prizes.find_one()
laureate = db.laureates.find_one()

# Print the sample prize and laureate documents
print(prize)
print(laureate)
print(type(laureate))

# Get the fields present in each type of document
'''Since prize and laureate are dictionaries, you can use the .keys() '''
prize_fields = list(prize.keys())
laureate_fields = list(laureate.keys())

print(prize_fields)
print(laureate_fields)
```
    ['year', '_id', 'overallMotivation', 'laureates', 'category']
    ['_id', 'prizes', 'bornCity', 'id', 'gender', 'died', 'diedCountry', 'bornCountryCode', 'firstname', 'bornCountry', 'surname', 'born', 'diedCountryCode']
## Finding documents
### # Simple documents
```py
db.laureates.count_docunents({"gender": "female"})
```

## "born" approximation
    # example
    db.laureates.count_documents({"born": {"$lt": "1900"}})
> Using the query format above, what is the number of laureates born prior to 1800? What about prior to 1700?
> 
- [ ] 38 prior to 1800, and 0 prior to 1700
- [ ] 324 prior to 1800, and 35 prior to 1700
- [x] 38 prior to 1800, and 38 prior to 1700

## Composing filters
- [x] 1.Create a filter criteria to count laureates who died ("diedCountry") in the USA ("USA"). Save the document count as count.
- [x] 2.Create a filter to count laureates who died in the United States but were born ("bornCountry") in Germany.
- [x] 3.Count laureates who died in the USA, were born in Germany, and whose first name ("firstname") was "Albert".
```py
# Create a filter for laureates who died in the USA
criteria = {"diedCountry": "USA"}

# Save the count of these laureates
count = db.laureates.count_documents(criteria)
print(count)
```
```py
# Create a filter for laureates who died in the USA but were born in Germany
criteria = {"diedCountry": "USA", 
            "bornCountry": "Germany"}

# Save the count
count = db.laureates.count_documents(criteria)
print(count)
```
```py
# Create a filter for Germany-born laureates who died in the USA and with the first name "Albert"
criteria = {"diedCountry": "USA", 
            "bornCountry": "Germany", 
            "firstname": "Albert"}

# Save the count
count = db.laureates.count_documents(criteria)
print(count)
```
## We've got options
- [x] 1. How many laureates were born in "USA", "Canada", or "Mexico"? Save a filter as criteria and your count as count.
- [x] 2. How many laureates died in the USA but were not born there? Save your filter as criteria and your count as count.
```py
# Save a filter for laureates born in the USA, Canada, or Mexico
criteria = { "bornCountry": 
                { "$in": ["USA","Canada","Mexico"]}
            }

# Count them and save the count
count = db.laureates.count_documents(criteria)
print(count)
```
```py
# Save a filter for laureates who died in the USA and were not born there
criteria = { "diedCountry": "USA",
               "bornCountry": { "$ne": "USA"}, 
             }

# Count them
count = db.laureates.count_documents(criteria)
print(count)
```
## # Dot notation
### # find empty fields
Multiple prizes
```py
db.laureates.count_documents({})

db.laureates.count.docunents({"prizes": {"$exists": True}})

db.laureates.count_.docunents({"prizes.0": {"$exists": True}})
```

## Choosing tools
> -If we want to count the number of laureates born in Austria with a prize ***affiliation*** country that is ***not*** also Austria, what MongoDB concepts/tools         should we use?

> (The nobel database is available in the console as db, and the Walter's Kohn document is available to you as doc. Feel free to examine the structure of the document   doc in the console, and play around with database queries!)
- [x] dot notation and the **$ne** operator
- [ ] dot notation and the **$exists** operator
- [ ] dot notation and the **$in** operator
- [ ] dot notation is not needed here, a query operator will suffice

## Starting our ascent
- [x] Save a filter criteria for laureates born in (bornCountry) "Austria" with a non-Austria prizes.affiliations.country.
- [x] Save your count of laureates as count.
```py
# Filter for laureates born in Austria with non-Austria prize affiliation
criteria = {"bornCountry": "Austria", 
              "prizes.affiliations.country": {"$ne": "Austria"}}

# Count the number of such laureates
count = db.laureates.count_documents(criteria)
print(count)
```
## Our 'born' approximation, and a special laureate
- [x] 1. Use a filter document (criteria) to count the documents that don't have a "born" field.
- [x] 2. Use a filter document (criteria) to find a document for a laureate with at least three elements in its "prizes" array. In other words, does a third element exist for the array? Remember about the zero-based indexing!

        db.laureates.count_documents({"born": "0000-00-00"})
```py
# Filter for documents without a "born" field
criteria = {'born': {"$exists": False}}

# Save count
count = db.laureates.count_documents(criteria)
print(count)
```
```py
# Filter for laureates with at least three prizes
criteria = {"prizes.2": {"$exists": True}}

# Find one laureate with at least three prizes
doc = db.laureates.find_one(criteria)

# Print the document
print(doc)
```
