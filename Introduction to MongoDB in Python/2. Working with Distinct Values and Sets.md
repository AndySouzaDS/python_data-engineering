## Categorical data validation
> What expression asserts that the distinct Nobel Prize categories catalogued by the "prizes" collection are the same as those catalogued by the
  "laureates"? Remember to explore example documents in the console via e.g. db.prizes.find_one() and db.laureates.find_one().

Possible Answers
- [ ] assert db.prizes.distinct("category") == db.laureates.distinct("prizes.category")
- [ ] assert db.prizes.distinct("laureates.category") == db.laureates.distinct("prizes.category")
- [x] assert set(db.prizes.distinct("category")) == set(db.laureates.distinct("prizes.category"))

## Never from there, but sometimes there at last
> There are some recorded countries of death ("diedCountry") that do not appear as a country of birth ("bornCountry") for laureates. One such country is "East Germany".

Instructions
- [x] Return a set of all such countries as countries.
```py
# Countries recorded as countries of death but not as countries of birth
countries = set(db.laureates.distinct("diedCountry")) - set(db.laureates.distinct("bornCountry"))
print(countries)
```

## Countries of affiliation
- [x] Determine the number of distinct countries recorded as part of an affiliation for laureates' prizes. Save this as count.
```py
# The number of distinct countries of laureate affiliation for prizes
count = len(db.laureates.distinct("prizes.affiliations.country"))
print(count)
```
    29
