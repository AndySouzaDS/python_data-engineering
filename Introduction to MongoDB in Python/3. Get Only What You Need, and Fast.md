## 🦍 Shares of the 1903 Prize in Physics
You want to examine the laureates of the 1903 prize in physics and how they split the prize. Here is a query without projection:

    db.laureates.find_one({"prizes": {"$elemMatch": {"category": "physics", "year": "1903"}}})
  
> Which projection(s) will fetch ***ONLY*** the laureates' full names and prize share info? I encourage you to experiment with the console and re-familiarize yourself with the structure of laureate collection documents.
