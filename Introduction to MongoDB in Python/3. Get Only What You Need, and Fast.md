## 🦍 Shares of the 1903 Prize in Physics
You want to examine the laureates of the 1903 prize in physics and how they split the prize. Here is a query without projection:

    db.laureates.find_one({"prizes": {"$elemMatch": {"category": "physics", "year": "1903"}}})
  
> Which projection(s) will fetch ***ONLY*** the laureates' full names and prize share info? I encourage you to experiment with the console and re-familiarize yourself with the structure of laureate collection documents.
- [ ] ["firstname", "surname", "prizes"]
- [ ] ["firstname", "surname", "prizes.share"]
- [x] {"firstname": 1, "surname": 1, "prizes.share": 1, "_id": 0}
- [ ] All of the above

## 🦍 Rounding up the G.S. crew
    { "name": {$regex: "^Py"}    }
will fetch documents where the field 'name' ***starts with "Py".***

> In this exercise, you will use regular expressions, projection, and list comprehension to collect the full names of laureates whose initials are "G.S.".

- [x] 1. First, use regular expressions to fetch the documents for the laureates whose "firstname" starts with "G" and whose "surname" starts with "S".
- [x] 2. Use projection and adjust the query to select only the "firstname" and "surname" fields.

```py
# Find laureates whose first name starts with "G" and last name starts with "S"
docs = db.laureates.find(
       filter= {"firstname" : {"$regex" : "^G"},
                "surname" : {"$regex" : "^S"}  })
# Print the first document 
print(docs[0])
```
```py
