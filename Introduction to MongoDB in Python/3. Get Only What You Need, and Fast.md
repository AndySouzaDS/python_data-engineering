## ü¶ç Shares of the 1903 Prize in Physics
You want to examine the laureates of the 1903 prize in physics and how they split the prize. Here is a query without projection:

    db.laureates.find_one({"prizes": {"$elemMatch": {"category": "physics", "year": "1903"}}})
  
> Which projection(s) will fetch ***ONLY*** the laureates' full names and prize share info? I encourage you to experiment with the console and re-familiarize yourself with the structure of laureate collection documents.
- [ ] ["firstname", "surname", "prizes"]
- [ ] ["firstname", "surname", "prizes.share"]
- [x] {"firstname": 1, "surname": 1, "prizes.share": 1, "_id": 0}
- [ ] All of the above

## ü¶ç Rounding up the G.S. crew
    { "name": {$regex: "^Py"}    }
will fetch documents where the field 'name' ***starts with "Py".***

> In this exercise, you will use regular expressions, projection, and list comprehension to collect the full names of laureates whose initials are "G.S.".

- [x] 1) First, use regular expressions to fetch the documents for the laureates whose "firstname" starts with "G" and whose "surname" starts with 
         "S".
- [x] 2) Use projection and adjust the query to select only the "firstname" and "surname" fields.
- [x] 3) Iterate over the documents, and for each document, concatenate the first name and the surname fields together with a space in between to obtain full names.

```py
# Find laureates whose first name starts with "G" and last name starts with "S"
docs = db.laureates.find(
       filter= {"firstname" : {"$regex" : "^G"},
                "surname" : {"$regex" : "^S"}  })
# Print the first document 
print(docs[0])
```
```py
# Use projection to select only firstname and surname
docs = db.laureates.find(
    filter={"firstname": {"$regex": "^G"},
            "surname": {"$regex": "^S"}},
    projection=["firstname", "surname"])


# Print the first document
print(docs[0])
```
```py
# Use projection to select only firstname and surname
docs = db.laureates.find(
       filter= {"firstname" : {"$regex" : "^G"},
                "surname" : {"$regex" : "^S"}  },
   projection= ["firstname", "surname"]  )

# Iterate over docs and concatenate first name and surname
full_names = [doc["firstname"] + " " + doc["surname"]  for doc in docs]

# Print the full names
print(full_names)
```
## ü¶ç Doing our share of data validation
Each "laureates.share" value appears to be the reciprocal of a laureate's fractional share of that prize, encoded as a string. For example, a laureate "share" of "4" means that this laureate received a 
 
 share of the prize. Let's check that for each prize, all the shares of all the laureates add up to 1!
 - [x] Save a list of prizes (prizes), projecting out only the "laureates.share" values for each prize.
 - [x] For each prize, compute the total share as follows:
 - [x] Initialize the variable total_share to 0.
 - [x] Iterate over the laureates for each prize, converting the "share" field of the "laureate" to float and adding the reciprocal of it (that is, 1 divided by it) to total_share.
 ```py
 # Save documents, projecting out laureates share
prizes = db.prizes.find({}, ["laureates.share"])

# Iterate over prizes
for prize in prizes:
    # Initialize total share
    total_share = 0

    # Iterate over laureates for the prize
    for laureate in prize["laureates"]:
        # add the share of the laureate to total_share
        total_share += 1 / float(laureate['share'])

    # Print the total share
    print(total_share)
```

## ü¶ç What the sort?
> This block prints out the first five projections of a sorted query. What "sort" argument fills the blank?
```py
docs = list(db.laureates.find(
    {"born": {"$gte": "1900"}, "prizes.year": {"$gte": "1954"}},
    {"born": 1, "prizes.year": 1, "_id": 0},
    sort=____))
for doc in docs[:5]:
    print(doc)
```
    {'born': '1916-08-25', 'prizes': [{'year': '1954'}]}
    {'born': '1915-06-15', 'prizes': [{'year': '1954'}]}
    {'born': '1901-02-28', 'prizes': [{'year': '1954'}, {'year': '1962'}]}
    {'born': '1913-07-12', 'prizes': [{'year': '1955'}]}
    {'born': '1911-01-26', 'prizes': [{'year': '1955'}]}
Possible Answers :
- [x] [("prizes.year", 1), ("born", -1)]
- [ ] {"prizes.year": 1, "born": -1}
- [ ] None
- [ ] [("prizes.year", 1)]

answer code :
```py
docs = list(db.laureates.find(
    {"born": {"$gte": "1900"}, "prizes.year": {"$gte": "1954"}},
    {"born": 1, "prizes.year": 1, "_id": 0},
    sort=[("prizes.year", 1), ("born", -1)]))
for doc in docs[:5]:
    print(doc)
```

##  ü¶ç Sorting together: MongoDB + Python
> You will use Python to sort laureates for one prize by last name, and then MongoDB to sort prizes by year:

     1901: R√∂ntgen
     1902: Lorentz and Zeeman
     1903: Becquerel and Curie and Curie, n√©e Sklodowska
You'll start by writing a function that takes a prize document as an argument, extracts all the laureates from that document, arranges them in alphabetical order, and returns a string containing the last names separated by " and "

The Nobel database is again available to you as db. We also pre-loaded a sample document sample_doc so you can test your laureate-extracting function.
(Remember that you can always type help(function_name) in console to get a refresher on functions you might be less familiar with, e.g. help(sorted)!)

---
Complete the definition of all_laureates(prize). Within the body of the function:
- [x] 1. Sort the "laureates" list of the prize document according to the "surname" key.
- [x] 1. For each of the laureates in the sorted list, extract the "surname" field.
- [x] 1. The code for joining the last names into a single string is already written for you.
- [x] 1. Take a look at the console to make sure the output looks like what you'd expect!
```py
from operator import itemgetter

def all_laureates(prize):  
  # sort the laureates by surname
  sorted_laureates = sorted(prize["laureates"], key=itemgetter("surname"))
  
  # extract surnames
  surnames = [laureate['surname'] for laureate in sorted_laureates]
  
  # concatenate surnames separated with " and " 
  all_names = " and ".join(surnames)
  
  return all_names

# test the function on a sample doc
print(all_laureates(sample_prize))
```
- [x] 2. Find the documents for the prizes in the physics category, sort them in chronological order (by "year", ascending), and only fetch the "year", "laureates.firstname", and "laureates.surname" fields.
```py
# find physics prizes, project year and first and last name, and sort by year
docs = db.prizes.find(
           filter= {"category": "physics"}, 
           projection= ['year', 'laureates.firstname', 'laureates.surname'], 
           sort= [('year', 1)])
```
- [x] 3. Now that you have the prizes, and the function to extract laureates from a prize, print the year and the names of the laureates (use your all_laureates() function) for each prize document.
```py
# print the year and laureate names (from all_laureates)
for doc in docs:
  print("{year}: {names}".format(year=doc['year'], names=all_laureates(doc)))
```

## ü¶ç Gap years
- [x] Find the original prize categories established in 1901 by looking at the distinct values of the "category" field for prizes from year 1901.
- [x] Fetch ONLY the year and category from all the documents (without the "_id" field).
- [x] Sort by "year" in descending order, then by "category" in ascending order.
```py
# original categories from 1901
original_categories = db.prizes.distinct('category', {'year': '1901'})
print(original_categories)

# project year and category, and sort
docs = db.prizes.find(
        filter={},
        projection = {'year':1, 'category':1, "_id":0},
        sort=[("year", -1), ("category", 1)]
)

#print the documents
for doc in docs:
  print(doc)
```
