## ü¶ç Sequencing stages
Here is a cursor, followed by four aggregation pipeline stages:

      cursor = (db.laureates.find(
          projection={"firstname": 1, "prizes.year": 1, "_id": 0},
          filter={"gender": "org"})
       .limit(3).sort("prizes.year", -1))

      project_stage = {"$project": {"firstname": 1, "prizes.year": 1, "_id": 0}}
      match_stage = {"$match": {"gender": "org"}}
      limit_stage = {"$limit": 3}
      sort_stage = {"$sort": {"prizes.year": -1}}
> What sequence pipeline of the above four stages can produce a cursor db.laureates.aggregate(pipeline) equivalent to cursor above?
Possible Answers
- [ ] [project_stage, match_stage, limit_stage, sort_stage]
- [ ] [project_stage, match_stage, sort_stage, limit_stage]
- [ ] [match_stage, project_stage, limit_stage, sort_stage]
- [x] [match_stage, project_stage, sort_stage, limit_stage]

## ü¶ç Aggregating a few individuals' country data
The following query cursor yields birth-country and prize-affiliation-country information for three non-organization laureates:

      cursor = (db.laureates.find(
          {"gender": {"$ne": "org"}},
          ["bornCountry", "prizes.affiliations.country"]
      ).limit(3))
- [x] Translate the above cursor cursor to an equivalent aggregation cursor, saving the pipeline stages to pipeline. Recall that the find collection method's "filter" parameter maps to the "$match" aggregation stage, its "projection" parameter maps to the "$project" stage, and the "limit" parameter (or cursor method) maps to the "$limit" stage.
```py
# Translate cursor to aggregation pipeline
pipeline = [
    {'$match': {'gender': {'$ne': 'org'}}},
    {'$project': {'bornCountry': 1, 'prizes.affiliations.country': 1}},
    {'$limit': 3}
]

for doc in db.laureates.aggregate(pipeline):
    print("{bornCountry}: {prizes}".format(**doc))
```

## ü¶ç Passing the aggregation baton to Python
- [x] Save to pipeline an aggregation pipeline to collect prize documents as detailed above. Use Python's collections.OrderedDict to specify any sorting.
```py
from collections import OrderedDict
from itertools import groupby
from operator import itemgetter

original_categories = set(db.prizes.distinct("category", {"year": "1901"}))

# Save an pipeline to collect original-category prizes
pipeline = [
    {"$match": {"category": {"$in": list(original_categories)}}},
    {"$project": {"category": 1, "year": 1}},
    {"$sort": OrderedDict([("year", -1)])}
]
cursor = db.prizes.aggregate(pipeline)
for key, group in groupby(cursor, key=itemgetter("year")):
    missing = original_categories - {doc["category"] for doc in group}
    if missing:
        print("{year}: {missing}".format(
            year=key, missing=", ".join(sorted(missing))))
```
## ü¶ç Field Paths and Sets
Previously, we confirmed -- via a Python loop -- that for each prize, either all laureates have a 1/3 share, or none do. Now, let's do this via an aggregation (result should be an empty list):

      list(db.prizes.aggregate([
          {"$project": {"allThree": {"$setEquals": [____, ____]},
                        "noneThree": {"$not": {"$setIsSubset": [____, ____]}}}},
          {"$match": {"$nor": [{"allThree": True}, {"noneThree": True}]}}]))
> Which values fill the blanks?

Possible Answers
- [x] "$laureates.share", ["3"], ["3"], "$laureates.share"
- [ ] "laureates.share", ["3"], ["3"], "laureates.share"
- [ ] "laureates.share", {"3"}, {"3"}, "laureates.share"
- [ ] "$laureates.share", {"3"}, {"3"}, "$laureates.share"
## ü¶ç Organizing prizes
In the slides at the beginning of this lesson, we saw a two-stage aggregation pipeline to determine the number of prizes awarded in total. How many prizes were awarded (at least partly) to organizations?
- [x] Fill out pipeline to determine the number of prizes awarded (at least partly) to organizations. To do this, you'll first need to $match on the "gender" that designates organizations.
- [x] Then, use a field path to project the number of prizes for each organization as the "$size" of the "prizes" array. Recall that to specify the value of a field "<my_field>", you use the field path "$<my_field>".
- [x] Finally, use a single group {"_id": None} to sum over the values of all organizations' prize counts.
```py
# Count prizes awarded (at least partly) to organizations as a sum over sizes of "prizes" arrays.
pipeline = [
    {"$match": {"gender": "org"}},
    {"$project": {"n_prizes": {"$size": "$prizes"}}},
    {"$group": {"_id": None, "n_prizes_total": {"$sum": "$n_prizes"}}}
]

print(list(db.laureates.aggregate(pipeline)))
```
      [{'_id': None, 'n_prizes_total': 27}]
## ü¶ç Gap years, aggregated
- [x] Make the $group stage output a document for each prize year (set "_id" to the field path for year) with the set of categories awarded that year.
- [x] Given your intermediate collection of year-keyed documents, $project a field named "missing" with the (original) categories not awarded that year. Again, mind your field paths!
- [x] Use a $match stage to only pass through documents with at least one missing prize category.
- [x] Finally, add sort documents in descending order.
```py
from collections import OrderedDict

original_categories = sorted(set(db.prizes.distinct("category", {"year": "1901"})))
pipeline = [
    {"$match": {"category": {"$in": original_categories}}},
    {"$project": {"category": 1, "year": 1}},
    
    # Collect the set of category values for each prize year.
    {"$group": {"_id": "$year", "categories": {"$addToSet": "$category"}}},
    
    # Project categories *not* awarded (i.e., that are missing this year).
    {"$project": {"missing": {"$setDifference": [original_categories, "$categories"]}}},
    
    # Only include years with at least one missing category
    {"$match": {"missing.0": {"$exists": True}}},
    
    # Sort in reverse chronological order. Note that "_id" is a distinct year at this stage.
    {"$sort": OrderedDict([("_id", -1)])},
]
for doc in db.prizes.aggregate(pipeline):
    print("{year}: {missing}".format(year=doc["_id"],missing=", ".join(sorted(doc["missing"]))))
```
## ü¶ç Embedding aggregation expressions
The `$expr` operator allows embedding of aggregation expressions in a normal query (or in a $match stage). Which of the following expressions counts the number of laureate documents with string-valued bornCountries when passed to `db.laureates.count_documents`?

You can assume (and check!) that the following is true:

      assert all(isinstance(v, str) for v in db.laureates.distinct("bornCountry"))
Possible Answers
- [ ] {"bornCountry": {"$in": db.laureates.distinct("bornCountry")}}
- [ ] {"$expr": {"$in": ["$bornCountry", db.laureates.distinct("bornCountry")]}}
- [ ] {"$expr": {"$eq": [{"$type": "$bornCountry"}, "string"]}}
- [ ] {"bornCountry": {"$type": "string"}}
- [x] All of the above
## ü¶ç Here and elsewhere
- [x] Use $unwind stages to ensure a single prize affiliation country per pipeline document.
- [x] Filter out prize-affiliation-country values that are "empty" (null, not present, etc.) -- ensure values are "$in" the list of known values.
- [x] Produce a count of documents for each value of "affilCountrySameAsBorn" (a field we've projected for you using the $indexOfBytes operator) by adding 1 to the running sum.
```py
key_ac = "prizes.affiliations.country"
key_bc = "bornCountry"
pipeline = [
    {"$project": {key_bc: 1, key_ac: 1}},

    # Ensure a single prize affiliation country per pipeline document
    {"$unwind": "$prizes"},
    {"$unwind": "$prizes.affiliations"},

    # Ensure values in the list of distinct values (so not empty)
    {"$match": {key_ac: {"$in": db.laureates.distinct(key_ac)}}},
    {"$project": {"affilCountrySameAsBorn": {
        "$gte": [{"$indexOfBytes": ["$"+key_ac, "$"+key_bc]}, 0]}}},

    # Count by "$affilCountrySameAsBorn" value (True or False)
    {"$group": {"_id": "$affilCountrySameAsBorn",
                "count": {"$sum": 1 }}},
]
for doc in db.laureates.aggregate(pipeline): print(doc)
```
## ü¶ç Countries of birth by prize category
- [x] $unwind the laureates array field to output one pipeline document for each array element.
- [x] After pulling in laureate bios with a $lookup stage, unwind the new laureate_bios array field (each laureate has only a single biography document).
- [x] Collect the set of bornCountries associated with each prize category.
- [x] Project out the size of each category's set of bornCountries.
```py
pipeline = [
    # Unwind the laureates array
    {"$unwind": "$laureates"},
    {"$lookup": {
        "from": "laureates", "foreignField": "id",
        "localField": "laureates.id", "as": "laureate_bios"}},

    # Unwind the new laureate_bios array
    {"$unwind": "$laureate_bios"},
    {"$project": {"category": 1,
                  "bornCountry": "$laureate_bios.bornCountry"}},

    # Collect bornCountry values associated with each prize category
    {"$group": {"_id": "$category",
                "bornCountries": {"$addToSet": "$bornCountry"}}},

    # Project out the size of each category's (set of) bornCountries
    {"$project": {"category": 1,
                  "nBornCountries": {"$size": "$bornCountries"}}},
    {"$sort": {"nBornCountries": -1}},
]
for doc in db.prizes.aggregate(pipeline): print(doc)
```
## ü¶ç "...it's the life in your years"
For the pipeline we developed in the last slide deck, I want you to replace the last ($bucket) stage with one such that, given the documents docs collected, we can get the following output:

      from operator import itemgetter

      print(max(docs, key=itemgetter("years")))
      print(min(docs, key=itemgetter("years")))

      {'firstname': 'Rita', 'surname': 'Levi-Montalcini', 'years': 103.0}
      {'firstname': 'Martin Luther', 'surname': 'King Jr.', 'years': 39.0}
You may assume that any earlier $project stage has been replaced by an equivalent $addFields stage

Possible Answers
- [x] {"$project": {"years": 1, "firstname": 1, "surname": 1, "_id": 0}}
- [ ] {"$addFields": {"firstname": 1, "surname": 1}}
- [ ] {"$project": {"firstname": 1, "surname": 1}}
- [ ] {"$project": {"firstname": 1, "surname": 1, "_id": 0}} 
## ü¶ç How many prizes were awarded to immigrants?
> How many prizes were awarded to people who had no affiliation in their country of birth at the time of the award?

Instructions
- [x] In your aggregation pipeline pipeline, use the "gender" field to limit results to people (that is, not organizations).
- [x] Count prizes for which the laureate's "bornCountry" is not also the "country" of any of their affiliations for the prize. Be sure to use field paths (precede a field name with "$") when appropriate.
