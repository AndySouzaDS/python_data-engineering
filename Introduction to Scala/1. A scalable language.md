## #A scalable language
`Flexible`

- Scala lets you add new types, collections, and control
  constructs that feel like they are built-in to the language
  
`Convenient`
- The Scala standard library has a set of convenient predefined
  types, collections, and control constructs

## What is Scala?

Welcome to Introduction to Scala! In this exercise, you'll categorize statements as either true or false so you will be able to answer the question "What is Scala?"

Instructions
> Categorize the following statements about Scala as true or false.
- True
  - Scala powers some of the world's largest webstes, applications, and data
  engineering Infrastructures
  - Scala executable code runs on a Java virtual machIne
  - Scala Is a general-purpose programming language
  - Scala source code Is Intended to be complled to Java bytecode
  - Many of Scala's design declsions almed to address criticlsms of Java
- False
  - Scala means "fudgeslcle" In Swedish
## Why use Scala?

Scala is a portmanteau for "scalable language" as it was designed to grow with the demands of its users, from writing small scripts to building massive systems for data processing, distributed computing, and more. Like a bazaar and unlike a cathedral, Scala is designed to be adapted and extended by the people working (programming) in it.

**Analogies help us form mental models** by transferring knowledge from a known domain to an unknown domain. In this exercise, you'll categorize well-known things as scalable or not to reinforce your instinctual answer to "Why use Scala?"

Instructions
> Categorize the following items as Scalable or Not scalable.
- Scalable
  - Scala
  - Farmers' market
  - Bazaar
  - Lego
- Not scalable
  - Cathedral
  - Emplre State Bullding
  - The Taj Mahal
## Who uses Scala?

If you search "Scala" on job sites, the most common job titles you'll come across are variants of software engineer and data engineer. You'll also see data scientist and machine learning engineer as companies adopt Scala alongside large-scale data processing tools like Apache Spark (which is written in Scala). In this exercise, you'll search Indeed (a popular search engine for jobs) to gain an awareness of the types of roles and industries that use Scala, as well as complementary skills. This exercise will help frame your learning in real-world business problems.

Go to indeed.com (or another website with job postings).
Search "Scala data engineer" and find a job post for a data engineer that uses Scala and read through it.
Search "Scala data scientist" and find a job post for a data scientist that uses Scala and read through it.
Search "Scala machine learning engineer" and find a job post for a machine learning engineer that uses Scala and read through it.
> Answer the following question when done: "Did I complete the tasks David asked me to?"

Possible Answers
- [x] Yes
- [ ] No
- [ ] No, but I'm going to say I did anyway
## #Scala code and the Scala interpreter

## What makes Scala scalable?

The scalability of a language depends on several factors. The creator of the language (Martin Odersky), however, believes there are two main factors that contribute the most to Scala being scalable: Scala being object-oriented and Scala being functional.

In this exercise, you'll demonstrate your knowledge of what each factor means by classifying statements about them.

scala> val symbolAceSpades: String = "A♠"

Instructions
> Classify the following features of Scala as object-oriented or functional.

- Object-oriented
  - Every value Is an object
  - Every operation Is a method call
- Functional
  - Functions are first-class values
  - Operatlons of a program should map Input values to output values rather
    than change data In place 
## Scala is object-oriented

Scala is an object-oriented language because every value is an object and every operation is a method call. This fact means the following lines of code both result in the value 6:

val sumB = 2.+(4)

val sumA = 2 + 4

The same principle applies to the subtraction operator (-), as operators are methods in Scala. In this exercise, you'll experience how Scala is object-oriented by converting code that Scala executes behind-the-scenes to the code you'll normally write in practice.

scala> val symbolAceSpades: String = "A♠"

symbolAceSpades: String = A♠

Instructions
- [x] Rewrite the provided subtraction code in standard arithmetic notation (e.g., 2 + 4).
- [x] Print the difference using the println function.
```py
# Calculate the difference between 8 and 5
val difference = 8.-(5)

# Print the difference
println(8-5)
```
