## # Scripts, applications, and real-world workflows

`scala scripts` instructions in a file executed sequently
- useful for smaller projects

### # Interpreted VS compiled language

- `Interpreter` : directly executes intructions in x programming language without compiling into machine code
- `Compiler` : translates source code from high to lower level programming language to be executed 
### # Scala apps

`scala apps`
- compiled explicily & run explicitly
- Consist many source files that can be compiled individually
- usefull for larger projects
- no LAG time cause apps are pre-compiled

## Create and run a Scala script

A script is a sequence of instructions in a file that are executed sequentially. When you clicked "Run Code" and "Submit Answer" in previous exercises, you actually ran a Scala script!

On your own computer, you won't have access to the "Run Code" and "Submit Answer" buttons like you do in exercises on DataCamp.

> In this exercise, you will order the workflow for creating and running a Scala script on your own computer.

Instructions
> Order the tasks in the workflow to create and run a Scala script that notifies players of the start a game of Twenty-One.

- [x] 1. Open a blank fle In your text editor of cholce.
  
- [x] 2. Write one lIlne of code In the fle: print ln ("Let 's play Twenty-One !")
  
- [x] 3. Save the file In your desired working directory with the name game.scala.
  
- [x] 4. Open a command prompt. Navigate to your destred working directory, then
     type scala game.scala and clck enter.
     
- [x] 5. Observe Let's play Twenty-One! printed to output.
## Benefits of compiled languages

The following are commonly listed benefits of Scala being a compiled language. What was the main benefit cited in the video?

Answer the question

- [ ] The Scala compiler is able to infer type (for variables and collections, for example) so programmers can choose to omit type annotations to make their code more concise.
- [ ] The Scala compiler is able to infer semicolons so programmers can choose to omit them to make their code more concise.
- [x] Compiled code performs better (i.e., is faster). This performance boost tend to grow in importance as program size grows.
- [ ] Compile times are getting faster, with a 5-10% improvement made in a recent release.
## # scala Functions

### # example:
```scala
//Define a function to determine if hand busts
def bust(hand: Int): Boolean {
hand 21
}

println(bust(20))
println(bust(22))
// False
// True
```
## What do functions do?

Before you can use functions, you need to understand what functions are conceptually.

> In this exercise, you'll answer the second subquestion of the larger "What is a function?" question: "What do functions do?"

Instructions

Fill in the blanks by reordering the provided words:
```
// Functions are Invoked with a list of arguments to produce a result.
```
## Identify the body of a function

In Twenty-One, it is useful to have a function that determines the maximum of two competing players' hands. For example, imagine a scenario where playerA and playerB have the following hands:

playerA: queenDiamonds, threeClubs, aceHearts (worth 1), fiveSpades
playerB: kingHearts, jackHearts
Below is a simple version of that function, called maxHand, that ignores whether or not the hand busts. It also has an if/else expression, which you will learn how to write in an upcoming lesson.
```scala
def maxHand(handA: Int, handB: Int): Int = {
  if (handA > handB) handA
  else handB
}
```
> In the previous video, the body of the function was emphasized as the only part of a function that you need to know for this course. What is the body of the     maxHand function?

Answer the question
- [ ] def maxHand(handA: Int, handB: Int)
- [ ] : Int =
- [ ] if (handA > handB) handA
- [ ] else handB
- [x] Everything within the curly braces.
## Call a function

Now it's time to actually use a function! As a reminder, here is the maxHand function that finds the maximum hand value between two hands (ignoring whether or not each hand busts):
```scala
def maxHand(handA: Int, handB: Int): Int = {
  if (handA > handB) handA
  else handB
}
```
> In this exercise, you'll create a variable to add the cards in each hand together, then call maxHand and pass in those variables as arguments to determine the maximum hand value. The maxHand function and the card variables you need are already defined.

Instructions
- [x] Calculate the hand value for playerA, who has the following cards: queenDiamonds, threeClubs, aceHearts (worth 1), fiveSpades.
- [x] Calculate the hand value for playerB, who has the following cards: kingHearts, jackHearts.
- [x] Call the maxHand function, passing in handPlayerA and handPlayerB as arguments. Pass this function call into the println function to print out the maximum hand value.
```scala
// Calculate hand values
val handPlayerA: Int = 19
val handPlayerB: Int = 20

// Find and print the maximum hand value
println(maxHand(handPlayerA,handPlayerB))
```
