`scala scripts` instructions in a file executed sequently
- useful for smaller projects

### # Interpreted VS compiled language

- `Interpreter` : directly executes intructions in x programming language without compiling into machine code
- `Compiler` : translates source code from high to lower level programming language to be executed 
### # Scala apps
