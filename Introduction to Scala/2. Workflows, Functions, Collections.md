## # Scripts, applications, and real-world workflows

`scala scripts` instructions in a file executed sequently
- useful for smaller projects

### # Interpreted VS compiled language

- `Interpreter` : directly executes intructions in x programming language without compiling into machine code
- `Compiler` : translates source code from high to lower level programming language to be executed 
### # Scala apps

`scala apps`
- compiled explicily & run explicitly
- Consist many source files that can be compiled individually
- usefull for larger projects
- no LAG time cause apps are pre-compiled

## Create and run a Scala script

A script is a sequence of instructions in a file that are executed sequentially. When you clicked "Run Code" and "Submit Answer" in previous exercises, you actually ran a Scala script!

On your own computer, you won't have access to the "Run Code" and "Submit Answer" buttons like you do in exercises on DataCamp.

> In this exercise, you will order the workflow for creating and running a Scala script on your own computer.

Instructions
> Order the tasks in the workflow to create and run a Scala script that notifies players of the start a game of Twenty-One.

- [x] 1. Open a blank fle In your text editor of cholce.
  
- [x] 2. Write one lIlne of code In the fle: print ln ("Let 's play Twenty-One !")
  
- [x] 3. Save the file In your desired working directory with the name game.scala.
  
- [x] 4. Open a command prompt. Navigate to your destred working directory, then
     type scala game.scala and clck enter.
     
- [x] 5. Observe Let's play Twenty-One! printed to output.
## Benefits of compiled languages

The following are commonly listed benefits of Scala being a compiled language. What was the main benefit cited in the video?

Answer the question

- [ ] The Scala compiler is able to infer type (for variables and collections, for example) so programmers can choose to omit type annotations to make their code more concise.
- [ ] The Scala compiler is able to infer semicolons so programmers can choose to omit them to make their code more concise.
- [x] Compiled code performs better (i.e., is faster). This performance boost tend to grow in importance as program size grows.
- [ ] Compile times are getting faster, with a 5-10% improvement made in a recent release.
## # scala Functions

### # example:
```scala
//Define a function to determine if hand busts
def bust(hand: Int): Boolean {
hand 21
}

println(bust(20))
println(bust(22))
// False
// True
```
## What do functions do?

Before you can use functions, you need to understand what functions are conceptually.

> In this exercise, you'll answer the second subquestion of the larger "What is a function?" question: "What do functions do?"

Instructions

Fill in the blanks by reordering the provided words:
```
// Functions are Invoked with a list of arguments to produce a result.
```
## Identify the body of a function

In Twenty-One, it is useful to have a function that determines the maximum of two competing players' hands. For example, imagine a scenario where playerA and playerB have the following hands:

playerA: queenDiamonds, threeClubs, aceHearts (worth 1), fiveSpades
playerB: kingHearts, jackHearts
Below is a simple version of that function, called maxHand, that ignores whether or not the hand busts. It also has an if/else expression, which you will learn how to write in an upcoming lesson.
```scala
def maxHand(handA: Int, handB: Int): Int = {
  if (handA > handB) handA
  else handB
}
```
> In the previous video, the body of the function was emphasized as the only part of a function that you need to know for this course. What is the body of the     maxHand function?

Answer the question
- [ ] def maxHand(handA: Int, handB: Int)
- [ ] : Int =
- [ ] if (handA > handB) handA
- [ ] else handB
- [x] Everything within the curly braces.
## Call a function

Now it's time to actually use a function! As a reminder, here is the maxHand function that finds the maximum hand value between two hands (ignoring whether or not each hand busts):
```scala
def maxHand(handA: Int, handB: Int): Int = {
  if (handA > handB) handA
  else handB
}
```
> In this exercise, you'll create a variable to add the cards in each hand together, then call maxHand and pass in those variables as arguments to determine the maximum hand value. The maxHand function and the card variables you need are already defined.

Instructions
- [x] Calculate the hand value for playerA, who has the following cards: queenDiamonds, threeClubs, aceHearts (worth 1), fiveSpades.
- [x] Calculate the hand value for playerB, who has the following cards: kingHearts, jackHearts.
- [x] Call the maxHand function, passing in handPlayerA and handPlayerB as arguments. Pass this function call into the println function to print out the maximum hand value.
```scala
// Calculate hand values
val handPlayerA: Int = 19
val handPlayerB: Int = 20

// Find and print the maximum hand value
println(maxHand(handPlayerA,handPlayerB))
```
## # Arrays

## Create and parameterize an array

The Scala Array is a mutable collection that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.

In the context of Twenty-One, an array is a good choice to represent something that can change, like the particular players playing (their names specifically). Something else that changes: the specific hands in each round.

> In this exercise, you'll create and parameterize an array for the first round of Twenty-One with three players (i.e., each player has one hand in this round). Note: you won't initialize the array with data yet!

Instructions
- [x] Create and parameterize an array (named hands) of type Int with a length of 3. Explicitly provide the type parameterization.
```scala
// Create and parameterize an array for a round of Twenty-One
val hands: Array[Int] = new Array[Int](3)
// hands: Array[Int] = Array(0, 0, 0)
```
## Initialize an array

Once parameterized, initializing the array is done by passing in the desired data inside parentheses ((___)). This contrasts with square brackets ([___]), like in programming languages like Java and Python. Arrays in Scala are zero-indexed.

In this exercise, you'll initialize the hands array you created and parameterized in the previous exercise with the starting hand (i.e., first two cards) for each player. The card variables you need are already defined (they are all of type Int).

Instructions
- [x] Initialize the first player's hand in the hands array.
- [x] Initialize the second player's hand in the hands array.
- [x] Initialize the third player's hand in the hands array.
```scala
// Create and parameterize an array for a round of Twenty-One
val hands: Array[Int] = new Array[Int](3)

// Initialize the first player's hand in the array
hands(0) = tenClubs + fourDiamonds

// Initialize the second player's hand in the array
hands(1) = nineSpades + nineHearts

// Initialize the third player's hand in the array
hands(2) = twoClubs + threeSpades

// hands: Array[Int] = Array(14, 18, 5)
```
## An array, all at once

In the previous exercises, you created and parameterized an array, then initialized it separately.

In this exercise, you'll experience performing all of these steps at once. The card variables you need are already defined.

Instructions
- [x] Create an array named hands.
- [x] Initialize the first player's hand to tenClubs + fourDiamonds.
- [x] Initialize the second player's hand to nineSpades + nineHearts.
- [x] Initialize the third player's hand to twoClubs + threeSpades.
```scala
// Create, parameterize, and initialize an array for a round of Twenty-One
val hands = Array(tenClubs + fourDiamonds,
              nineSpades + nineHearts,
              twoClubs + threeSpades)

// hands: Array[Int] = Array(14, 18, 5)
```
## Updating arrays

Since arrays are mutable, the elements in them can be updated.

In the context of Twenty-One, this could mean adding to an element in the array if that player chooses to hit to get closer to 21.

In this exercise, you'll do just that. The card variables you need are already defined, as well as the hands array you created, parameterized, and initialized previously.

If you run the code more than once, you will keep adding to hands since arrays are mutable. Your final result will then be different from the expected solution. Reloading the page will reset the hands array.

Instructions
- [x] Add a fiveClubs to the first player's hand in hands.
- [x] Add a queenSpades to the second player's hand in hands.
- [x] Add a kingClubs to the third player's hand in hands
```scala
// Initialize player's hand and print out hands before each player hits
hands(0) = tenClubs + fourDiamonds
hands(1) = nineSpades + nineHearts
hands(2) = twoClubs + threeSpades
hands.foreach(println)

// Add 5♣ to the first player's hand
hands(0) = hands(0) + fiveClubs

// Add Q♠ to the second player's hand
hands(1) = hands(1) + queenSpades

// Add K♣ to the third player's hand
hands(2) = hands(2) + kingClubs

// Print out hands after each player hits
hands.foreach(println)
```
## # scala Lists

## Initialize and prepend to a list

The List in Scala is like the Array in that they are a sequence of objects that share the same type. The List collection, however, is immutable. When performing operations on lists, the result will be a new list with a new value. The cons operator (::) prepends an element to a list.

Imagine you wanted to raise the stakes a little when playing Twenty-One by adding a monetary prize for each round. The winner of round one gets $10, the winner of round two gets $15, etc.

> In this exercise, you'll create a list to store these prize values for five rounds, then prepend to it to accommodate another round.

Instructions
- [x] Initialize a list named prizes with an element for each round's prize, where the first through fifth round's prizes are 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30, respectively.
- [x] Prepend to prizes using the cons (::) operator so a new first round is added, worth $5. Name the new list newPrizes.

```scala
// Initialize a list with an element for each round's prize
val prizes = List(10, 15, 20, 25, 30)
println(prizes)

// Prepend to prizes to add another round and prize
// first price is now $5
val newPrizes = 5 :: prizes 
println(newPrizes)

// List(10, 15, 20, 25, 30)
// List(5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30)
```
## Initialize a list using cons and Nil

You just initialized the prizes list like this:

val prizes = List(10, 15, 20, 25, 30)
That's works great! There's also another commonly used technique that combines the cons `(::) operator` and `Nil`, which is the empty list.

> In this exercise, you'll initialize the same prizes list from last exercise, just using this fancy, efficient shorthand.

Instructions
- [x] Using :: and Nil, initialize a list named prizes with an element each round's prize, where the first through fifth round's prizes are 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30, respectively.
```scala
// Initialize a list with an element each round's prize
val prizes = 10 :: 15 :: 20 :: 25 :: 30 :: Nil
println(prizes)
```
