## # Scripts, applications, and real-world workflows

`scala scripts` instructions in a file executed sequently
- useful for smaller projects

### # Interpreted VS compiled language

- `Interpreter` : directly executes intructions in x programming language without compiling into machine code
- `Compiler` : translates source code from high to lower level programming language to be executed 
### # Scala apps

`scala apps`
- compiled explicily & run explicitly
- Consist many source files that can be compiled individually
- usefull for larger projects
- no LAG time cause apps are pre-compiled

## Create and run a Scala script

A script is a sequence of instructions in a file that are executed sequentially. When you clicked "Run Code" and "Submit Answer" in previous exercises, you actually ran a Scala script!

On your own computer, you won't have access to the "Run Code" and "Submit Answer" buttons like you do in exercises on DataCamp.

> In this exercise, you will order the workflow for creating and running a Scala script on your own computer.

Instructions
> Order the tasks in the workflow to create and run a Scala script that notifies players of the start a game of Twenty-One.

- [x] 1. Open a blank fle In your text editor of cholce.
  
- [x] 2. Write one lIlne of code In the fle: print ln ("Let 's play Twenty-One !")
  
- [x] 3. Save the file In your desired working directory with the name game.scala.
  
- [x] 4. Open a command prompt. Navigate to your destred working directory, then
     type scala game.scala and clck enter.
     
- [x] 5. Observe Let's play Twenty-One! printed to output.
## Benefits of compiled languages

The following are commonly listed benefits of Scala being a compiled language. What was the main benefit cited in the video?

Answer the question

- [ ] The Scala compiler is able to infer type (for variables and collections, for example) so programmers can choose to omit type annotations to make their code more concise.
- [ ] The Scala compiler is able to infer semicolons so programmers can choose to omit them to make their code more concise.
- [x] Compiled code performs better (i.e., is faster). This performance boost tend to grow in importance as program size grows.
- [ ] Compile times are getting faster, with a 5-10% improvement made in a recent release.
## # scala Functions

### # example:
```scala
//Define a function to determine if hand busts
def bust(hand: Int): Boolean {
hand 21
}

println(bust(20))
println(bust(22))
// False
// True
```
## What do functions do?

Before you can use functions, you need to understand what functions are conceptually.

> In this exercise, you'll answer the second subquestion of the larger "What is a function?" question: "What do functions do?"
