## # Scripts, applications, and real-world workflows

`scala scripts` instructions in a file executed sequently
- useful for smaller projects

### # Interpreted VS compiled language

- `Interpreter` : directly executes intructions in x programming language without compiling into machine code
- `Compiler` : translates source code from high to lower level programming language to be executed 
### # Scala apps

`scala apps`
- compiled explicily & run explicitly
- Consist many source files that can be compiled individually
- usefull for larger projects
- no LAG time cause apps are pre-compiled

## Create and run a Scala script

A script is a sequence of instructions in a file that are executed sequentially. When you clicked "Run Code" and "Submit Answer" in previous exercises, you actually ran a Scala script!

On your own computer, you won't have access to the "Run Code" and "Submit Answer" buttons like you do in exercises on DataCamp.

> In this exercise, you will order the workflow for creating and running a Scala script on your own computer.

Instructions
- [x] Order the tasks in the workflow to create and run a Scala script that notifies players of the start a game of Twenty-One.
