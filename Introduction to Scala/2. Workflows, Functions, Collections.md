## # Scripts, applications, and real-world workflows

`scala scripts` instructions in a file executed sequently
- useful for smaller projects

### # Interpreted VS compiled language

- `Interpreter` : directly executes intructions in x programming language without compiling into machine code
- `Compiler` : translates source code from high to lower level programming language to be executed 
### # Scala apps

`scala apps`
- compiled explicily & run explicitly
- Consist many source files that can be compiled individually
- usefull for larger projects
- no LAG time cause apps are pre-compiled
