## Static typing vs. dynamic typing

The following definitions may be helpful:

`Type:` restricts the possible values to which a variable can refer, or an expression can produce, at run time.

`Compile time:` source code translated into machine code

`Run time:` when executing commands (after compilation, if compiled).

Instructions
> Categorize the statements as true for Statically-typed languages or true for Dynamically-typed languages.

- Statically-typed language
  - The type of a varlable Is known at complle time `all processes BEFORE`
  - Types are checked before executlon tme
  - Types are checked before run time
- Dynamically- typed language `all processes DURING`
  - Types are checked on the fily
  - Types are checked durlng run time
  - Types are checked during execution
## Pros and cons of static type systems

A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. That is, types are checked before run time. There are pros and cons that are commonly associated with the majority of static type systems. Scala's implementation of a static type system, which is advanced, attempts to address some of the cons.

In this exercise, you'll categorize statements about static type systems as either a pro, a con, or a con that is addressed by a feature of Scala's static type system.

Instructions
> Categorize the following qualities of static type systems as a Pro, a Con, or a Cons addressed by Scala's type system.

- Pros
  - Increased performance at run time
  - Your program behaves as expected (1.e.
    prove the absence of common type-related
    bugs)
  - Safe refactorings
  - Documentation In the form of type
    annotatlons (: Int In
    val fourHearts : Int 4)
- Cons
  - The time It takes to check types
- Cons addressed by Scala's type system
  - The language Is not flexlble (e.g. one strict
    way of composing a type)
  - Code Is verbose (.e., code Is longer/more
    annoylng to wrlte)
