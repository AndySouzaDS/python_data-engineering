## Static typing vs. dynamic typing

The following definitions may be helpful:

`Type:` restricts the possible values to which a variable can refer, or an expression can produce, at run time.

`Compile time:` source code translated into machine code

`Run time:` when executing commands (after compilation, if compiled).

Instructions
> Categorize the statements as true for Statically-typed languages or true for Dynamically-typed languages.

- Statically-typed language
  - The type of a varlable Is known at complle time `all processes BEFORE`
  - Types are checked before executlon tme
  - Types are checked before run time
- Dynamically- typed language `all processes DURING`
  - Types are checked on the fily
  - Types are checked durlng run time
  - Types are checked during execution
