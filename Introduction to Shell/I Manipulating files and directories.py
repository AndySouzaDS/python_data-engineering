""" brief introduction to the Unix shell. You'll learn why it is still in use after almost 50 years, how it compares to the graphical tools
you may be more familiar with, how to move around in the shell, and how to create, modify, and delete files and folders.
"""


## How does the shell compare to a desktop interface?
"""---What is the relationship between the graphical file explorer that most people use and the command-line shell?"""
# They are both interfaces for issuing commands to the operating system.


## Where am I?
  """ >>>>>> $ pwd === print working directory."""
# /home/repl


## How can I identify files and directories?
  """ >>>>>> $ cd === go inside directory."""
  """ >>>>>> $ ls ===  list the files in the directory."""

"""---Which of these files is not in that directory?."""
# $ cd seasonal
# $ ls         
# fall.csv


## How else can I identify files and directories?
""" **PATH : If it begins with /, it is absolute. If it does not begin with /, it is relative."""
