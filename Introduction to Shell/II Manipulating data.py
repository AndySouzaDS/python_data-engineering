"""
This chapter will show you how to work with the data in those files. The tools weâ€™ll use are fairly simple, but are solid building blocks.
"""

## How can I view a file's contents?
""" >>>>>> cat === quick view of contents."""
# $ cat course.txt
"""Introduction to the Unix Shell for Data Science......"""


## How can I view a file's contents piece by piece?
""" >>>>>> less === one page at a time, passing with [SPACE], leaving with [q]
    >>>>>> :n  , :p  === next and previous file when using less.
    >>>>>> :q  === quit."""
# $ less seasonal/spring.csv seasonal/summer.csv
# :n
# :p
# :q


## How can I look at the start of a file?
""" >>>>>> head === look at the start of a file."""
# $ head people/agarwal.txt
# | Display as many lines as there are.


## How can I type less?
""" >>>>>> [TAB] === autocompletition"""
"""Run head seasonal/autumn.csv without typing the full filename."""
# $ head seasonal/autumn.csv  
# $ head seasonal/spring.csv


## How can I control what commands do?
"""FLAGS
---------"""
""" >>>>>> head -n 10 === first 10 results."""
# $ head -n 5 seasonal/winter.csv


## How can I list everything below a directory?
""" >>>>>> ls -R  === see every file and directory in the current level, then everything in each sub-directory.
    >>>>>> ls -F === puts '/' after a directory. puts '*' after runnable program."""
# $ ls -R -F.:

## How can I get help for a command?
""" >>>>>> man === (maual) find out what commands DO.---invokes 'less', use [SPACE] to see more [q] to quit"""
# $ man tail   [SPACE][q]
# $ tail -n +7 seasonal/spring.csv


## How can I select COLUMNS from a file?
""" >>>>>> cut === select columns."""
         # cut -f 2-5,8 -d , values.csv
                     #-f(specify columns), -d(delimiter to specify the separator)--because some files may use spaces, tabs, or colons
"""---What command will select the first column (containing dates) from the file spring.csv?"""
"""cut -d , -f 1 seasonal/spring.csv
    cut -d, -f1 seasonal/spring.csv"""
# Either of the above.


## What can't cut do?
"""---What is the output of cut -d : -f 2-4 on the line:"""
# second:third:
# |  The trailing colon creates an empty fourth field.


## How can I repeat commands?
""" >>>>>> history === see latest command history."""
# $ head summer.csv
# $ cd seasonal/
# $ !head
"""head summer.csv

## How can I select lines containing specific values?
""" >>>>>> grep === selects lines according to what they contain"""
#   ...... grep bicuspid seasonal/winter.csv ---------------prints lines from winter.csv that contain "bicuspid".
"""grep's more common flags:----------"""
# -c: print a count of matching lines rather than the lines themselves
# -h: do not print the names of files when searching multiple files
# -i: ignore case (e.g., treat "Regression" and "regression" as matches)
# -l: print the names of files that contain matches, not the matches
# -n: print line numbers for matching lines
# -v: invert the match, i.e., only show lines that don't match
"""Print the contents of all of the lines containing the word molar in seasonal/autumn.csv by running a single command while in your home directory. Don't use any flags."""
# $ grep molar seasonal/autumn.csv

## Why isn't it always safe to treat data as text?
# $ man paste 
# $ paste -d -n seasonal/autumn.csv seasonal/winter.csv
# | The last few rows have the wrong number of columns.
