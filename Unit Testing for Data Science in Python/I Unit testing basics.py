you will get introduced to the pytest package and use it to write simple unit tests. You'll run the tests,
interpret the test result reports and fix bugs. Throughout the chapter, we will use examples exclusively from the data preprocessing module of a linear regression 
project, making sure you learn unit testing in the context of data science.
