"""
testing complicated data types like NumPy arrays to testing exception handling, you'll do it all. Once you have mastered the science of testing,
we will also focus on the arts. For example, we will learn how to find the balance between writing too many tests and too few tests. In the last lesson,
you will get introduced to a radically new programming methodology called Test Driven Development (TDD) and put it to practice. This might actually change
the way you code forever!
