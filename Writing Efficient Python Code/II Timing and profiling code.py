  You will learn how to gather and compare runtimes between different coding approaches. You'll practice using the line_profiler 
and memory_profiler packages to profile your code base and spot bottlenecks. Then, you'll put your learnings to practice by replacing
these bottlenecks with efficient Python code.

    @ Why timing code?
    
      # Allows to pick 'optimal' code approach
      # Faster == more 'efficient'
      
     How to time code?
     =================
    
      >>>>>>> %timeit ====calculate runtime with IPython 'magic command'
      >>>>>>> 'magic command' ===goes on 'top' of normal python syntax, prefixed by " % "
      >>>>>>> %lsmagic ===== see all magic commands
      
          import numpy as np 
          %timeit rand_nums = np.random.rand(1000)
          # provides AVG of timing statistics
          
     Specify number of runs and loops
     =================================
      >>>>>>> -r ===set number of runs
      >>>>>>> -n ===set number of loops
